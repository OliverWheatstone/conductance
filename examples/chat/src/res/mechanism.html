<div class="info">
<h3 class="feature">Mechanism</h3>
<p>A mechanism is a function attached to a HTML widget, using the SYMBOL(mho:surface/html,Mechanism) function.
When the widget is added to the document, any attached mechanism functions are called.
When the widget is removed from the document, the function is cancelled (if it hasn't already completed).
</p>

<p>Mechanisms encourage self-contained, modular widgets - you can add a widget to a page multiple times,
and the attached mechanism will be called independently for each instance, using a different `elem`
argument.</p>
