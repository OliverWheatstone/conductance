<div class="info">
<h3 class="feature">Mechanism</h3>
<p>A mechanism is a function attached to a HTML widget, using the SYMBOL(mho:surface/html,Mechanism) function.
When the widget is added to the document, any attached mechanisms are called.
When the widget is removed from the document, the relevent functions are cancelled (if they haven't already completed).
</p>

<p>Mechanisms encourage self-contained, modular widgets - you can add a widget to a page multiple times,
and the attached mechanism will be called independently for each instance, using a different `elem`
argument.</p>
