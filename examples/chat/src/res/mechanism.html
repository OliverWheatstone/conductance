<div class="info">
<h3 class="feature">Mechanism</h3>
<p>A mechanism is a function attached to a HTML widget, using the $SYMBOL(mho:surface/html,Mechanism) function.
When a widget is added to the document, any attached mechanisms are called.
When the widget is removed from the document, the relevent functions are aborted (if they haven't already completed).
</p>

<p>Mechanisms encourage self-contained, modular widgets - you can add a widget to a page multiple times,
and the attached mechanism will be called independently for each instance, each being passed a different `elem`
argument.</p>
