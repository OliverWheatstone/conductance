<div class="info">
<h3 class="feature">Function blocks</h3>
<p>
SJS adds a block syntax, which is similar to blocks in the ruby language.
Blocks are appended to the existing arguments, so:
</p>

<pre><code>fn(arg) {|x, y| /\* body \*/ }</code></pre>

<p>Is similar to:</p>

<pre><code>fn(arg, function(x, y) { /\* body \*/ })</code></pre>

<p>
The above code is equivalent, but blocks do behave differently to
regular functions when they include `continue`, `break` or `return` statements,
as well as retaining the same `this` reference inside the block.
