<h3 class="syntax">Double-dots</h3>
<p>SJS adds the <code>..</code> ("double-dot") syntax as a convenient way
to use functional APIs while maintaining the familiar look and chainaing ability
of Object-Oriented APIs.</p>

<p>Essentially, `a .. fn(b, c)` transforms into `fun(a, b, c)`.
Since a lot of functions in conductance (and SJS) take their "subject" as a first argument,
this allows us to extend objects unobtrusively. e.g to iterate over an array, you can do:

<pre><code>[1, 2, 3] .. map(elem -&gt; elem \* 2)</code></pre>

<p>Which actually results in the following call:</p>

<pre><code>map([1, 2, 3], elem -&gt; elem \* 2)</code></pre>

<p>We could have added the `map` method to Array.prototype, but using
a simple function allows `map` to work on multiple types of objects
(arrays, infinite streams and `arguments` objects).
Using plain functions also means we don't have to fight with other
libraries that might also want to add their own Array functions.
