<div class="info">
<h3 class="feature">hold()</h3>
<p>
`hold(ms)` is a builtin function that waits for a number of milliseconds and then returns.
If we don't pass a timeout argument, it waits indefinitely.

Note that `hold()` is not actually synchronous under the covers - it has the same performance as setTimeout(), and doesn't block other code from executing.
