<h3 class="feature">.api modules</h3>
<p>Requiring an .api module from the browser actually generates a module
that creates a bidirectional connection to the server running
the given API.</p>
<p>All methods called on this API will asynchronously call the relevant
code on the server and suspend until the return value is ready.</p>
