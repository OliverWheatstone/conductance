<div class="info">
<h3 class="feature">.api modules</h3>
<p>Requiring an .api module from the browser actually generates a module
that creates a connection to the server running the given API.
All methods called on this API will asynchronously call the relevant
code on the server, but each call will wait for the result from the
server before continuing.</p>
