Oni Apollo: Multi-Platform StratifiedJS Implementation
======================================================

(c) 2010-2013 Oni Labs, http://onilabs.com

The Oni Apollo distribution is made available as open-source.

All client-side components of the distribution are licensed under the MIT License.
Some server-side components are licensed under the GPL v2.

The upshot is that if you use Apollo purely on the client-side via the 
cross-browser oni-apollo.js runtime and the standard module library, there are no 
restrictions placed on your application. 
If you use Apollo on the server-side, or you use the StratifiedJS compiler 
or virtual machine directly (i.e. not via oni-apollo.js) in another product, 
then that product also needs to be licensed under the GPL.

Alternative licensing available; for enquiries please contact alex@onilabs.com
